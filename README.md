Tax price calculation using javascript

Create an event handler to run whenever the #price value has changed ("change"
event).
7. In the event handler, calculate the amount of tax (13%) that would be added to the price
value (use the .val() method to get the value), and insert the calculated tax amount![Screenshot 2022-05-26 150155](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98704309/170558904-2afbbd0f-8f54-4668-a109-252f1468234e.jpg)

into the span#tax element, with a dollar sign at the start of it.
8. Use the built in .toFixed() method to round the number to dollars and cents. You
should be displaying number values with 2 decimal places.
