          <p>As Messi maintained his goalscoring form into the second half of the season,
           the year 2012 saw him break several longstanding records. 
           On 7 March, two weeks after scoring four goals in a league fixture against Valencia,
            he scored five times in a Champions League last 16-round match against Bayer Leverkusen, 
            an unprecedented achievement in the history of the competition.
            In addition to being the joint top assist provider with five assists, 
            this feat made him top scorer with 14 goals, 
            tying José Altafini's record from the 1962–63 season, 
            as well as becoming only the second player after Gerd Müller to be top scorer in four campaigns.
            Two weeks later, on 20 March, Messi became the top goalscorer in Barcelona's history at 24 years old, 
            overtaking the 57-year record of César Rodríguez's 232 goals with a hat-trick against Granada.</p>

          <p> A starter for the first time,
           he gave a well-received performance against Fabio Capello's Juventus, 
           receiving an ovation from the Camp Nou. While Capello requested to loan Messi, 
           a bid to buy him came from Inter Milan, 
           who were willing to pay his €150 million buyout clause and triple his wages.
           According to then-president Joan Laporta,
            it was the only time the club faced a real risk of losing Messi,
             but he ultimately decided to stay.On 16 September,
              his contract was updated for the second time in three months and extended to 2014</p>
